    "Employee turnover is a critical challenge for organizations as it directly impacts productivity, morale, and financial performance. High turnover rates can lead to increased recruitment and training costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and disruptions to team dynamics. Understanding the factors that drive employees to leave is essential for developing effective retention strategies. Variables such as compensation (payment tier), job satisfaction (benching status), demographic characteristics (age, gender), and professional qualifications (education, experience) often play significant roles in influencing turnover. By leveraging data-driven methods like logistic regression, organizations can identify key predictors of employee turnover and quantify their impact, enabling proactive interventions to enhance workforce stability."
